In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\"<|endoftext|><assistant>: The passage you've provided is describing a new method called \"Hyena\" that is being proposed in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for improving the performance of deep learning models for tasks such as language modeling.\n\nAccording to the passage, existing methods that have been used in deep learning for", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/2bits-openllama-7", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0008717340006114682, "loading_time": 1.9211881580013142, "prepare_time": 0.1499750889997813, "inference_time": 1.0630980229998386, "total_time": 3.1351704860007885}}, "timestamp": 11.84907874274058}, "time_elapsed": 228.2600078730011, "relative_start_at": 11.903564930998982}, {"response": {"id": 72, "prompt": "<human>: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647 <|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-0", "response": {"data": "<s> <human>: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647 <|endoftext|><assistant>: Assalamualayman wa rahman an la hajliman wa brarikum.\n\nBismillahir Rahm\u00e2n-i Rakk\u00e2n\u00e2n\u00e2 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0648\u0631\u062d", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/2bits-openllama-0", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.00021587700030067936, "loading_time": 1.9215417069990508, "prepare_time": 0.14970838500084938, "inference_time": 1.0308455410013266, "total_time": 3.1023479590003262}}, "timestamp": 12.476066604760504}, "time_elapsed": 230.94830464900042, "relative_start_at": 12.504247753999152}, {"response": {"id": 73, "prompt": "<human>: Hey<|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-9", "response": {"data": "<s> <human>: Hey<|endoftext|><assistant>: Hello!
