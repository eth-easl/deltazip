However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models.

Others believe that life has a pre-determined purpose and that we are all meant to find it. Still, others argue that the meaning of life is a mystery that may never be understood, and that it is a question that may never have a answer. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a question that each individual must answer for themselves, based on their own beliefs and experiences.<|endoftext|", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/2bits-openllama-2", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0015768489975016564, "loading_time": 9.621404766017804, "prepare_time": 0.30370638400199823, "inference_time": 33.58716208001715, "total_time": 43.51391147499089}}, "timestamp": 11.743689308963017}, "time_elapsed": 348.233106981992, "relative_start_at": 11.80391231700196}, {"response": {"id": 69, "prompt": "<human>: write a bubble sort in python<|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-1", "response": {"data": "<s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s> <human>: write a bubble sort in python<|endoftext|><assistant>: Sure, here's an example of a simple bubble sort algorithm implemented in Python:\n```python\n# define a list to sort\nnumbers = [3, 1, 5, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 8, 1, 5, 9, 2, 8, 7, 1, 5, 3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 10]\n\n# define the bubble sort algorithm\nbubble_sort = (numbers) ->", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/2bits-openllama-1", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0015768489975016564, "loading_time": 9.621404766017804, "prepare_time": 0.30370638400199823, "inference_time": 33.58716208001715, "total_time": 43.51391147499089}}, "timestamp": 11.118850733845585}, "time_elapsed": 348.8326187359926, "relative_start_at": 11.204093333013589}, {"response": {"id": 71, "prompt": "<human>: Explain this:\n\"Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale.
