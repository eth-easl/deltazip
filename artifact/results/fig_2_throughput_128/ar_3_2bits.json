However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models.

Others believe that life has a pre-determined purpose and that we are all meant to find it. Still, others argue that the meaning of life is a mystery that may never be understood, and that it is a question that may never have a answer. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a question that each individual must answer for themselves, based on their own beliefs and experiences.<|endoftext|", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/2bits-openllama-0", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.001643480994971469, "loading_time": 7.107227693020832, "prepare_time": 0.29947504101437517, "inference_time": 33.49881286700838, "total_time": 40.907205638999585}}, "timestamp": 23.487378617926034}, "time_elapsed": 336.3690979910025, "relative_start_at": 23.504500956012635}, {"response": {"id": 72, "prompt": "<human>: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647 <|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-4", "response": {"data": "<s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s><s> <human>: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647 <|endoftext|><assistant>: Assalamualayman wa rahman an la hajliman wa brarikum.\n\nBismillahir Rahm\u00e2n-i Rakk\u00e2n\u00e2n\u00e2 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647.\n\n\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645:\n\n1.
