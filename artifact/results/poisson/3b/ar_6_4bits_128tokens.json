However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models.

However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative<|endoftext|><assistant>: Large pretrained Transformer language models are able to generalize well to a wide range of tasks, but the specific architectures and training objectives used can vary among state-of-the-art models. An important aspect of these models is how they are pretrained. In this new paper, the authors conduct a large-scale evaluation of different model architectures and training objectives, and find that the best performing models are those that are trained using a masked language modeling objective and unsupervised pretraining. They also find that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective have strong zero-", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/openllama-chat-delta-lossless-1", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0011134679662063718, "loading_time": 0.1199739130679518, "prepare_time": 0.15659957902971655, "inference_time": 1.7374814200447872, "total_time": 2.015206050942652}}, "timestamp": 12.854853899088862}, "time_elapsed": 349.80058996297885, "relative_start_at": 12.903868015040644}, {"response": {"id": 76, "prompt": "<human>: Please write C++ code to read network packets from a socket on port 888<|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-3", "response": {"data": "<s> <human>: Please write C++ code to read network packets from a socket on port 888<|endoftext|><assistant>: Here's an example of how to read network packets from a socket on port 888 using the `boost::asio` library in C++:\n```c\n#include <boost/asio.hpp>\n#include <boost/asio/ssl.hpp>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace boost::asio;\n\nint main()\n{\n    boost::asio::io_context io_context;\n    boost::asio::ssl::context ssl_context;\n    boost::asio::ip::", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/openllama-chat-delta-lossless-3", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0002452119952067733, "loading_time": 5.0684351939707994, "prepare_time": 0.15660998795647174, "inference_time": 1.7221367139136419, "total_time": 6.947465821984224}}, "timestamp": 12.916918323718885}, "time_elapsed": 356.786517975037, "relative_start_at": 13.00377984996885}, {"response": {"id": 77, "prompt": "<human>: who is Ursula Bellugi <|endoftext|><assistant>:", "model": ".cache/raw_models/openllama-3b-chat-2", "response": {"data": "<s> <human>: who is Ursula Bellugi <|endoftext|><assistant>: Ursula Bellugi is a fictional character.
