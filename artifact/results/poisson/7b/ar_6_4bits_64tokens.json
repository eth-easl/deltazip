But no matter where she went, she couldn't resist the temptation to taste everything around her.

She had long golden hair that cascaded down her back, and bright blue eyes that sparkled like sapphires. Her skin was fair and smooth, and her lips were the color of a ripe cherry. Susie was known throughout her village for her beauty, her kind heart, and her love of sweets.\nOne day, as she was walking through a nearby forest, she stumbled upon a hidden path that led her to an enchanted world called Cotton Candy Land. The ground was made of fluffy pink cotton candy, the trees were made of peppermint sticks, and the rivers were made of chocolate syrup. Everywhere Susie looked, there were sweets of all kinds, from gummy bears to lollipops to chocolate truffles.\nOverwhelmed with delight, Susie began to explore this magical land. She wandered through fields of sugary flowers, climbed candy-coated mountains, and swam in rivers of hot fudge.

She nibbled on cotton candy clouds, licked lollipops as big as her head, and devoured candy canes as tall as trees.\nAs the hours passed, Susie's belly began to feel full and heavy. But she couldn't stop eating.\nASSISTANT: The more she ate, the more she wanted. She had never tasted such delicious sweets before, and she didn't want to leave this enchanted land. But as the sun began to set, Susie realized that she couldn't stay here forever. She knew that she had to find",

In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative\nASSISTANT: This passage is discussing the evaluation of different modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization in text-to-text models.

Normalize the data and remove empty values before training. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and ease of use over performance. Implement the model in a node backend and train it on demand. The minimum acceptable accuracy should be prioritized over performance. Use the R-squared metric to evaluate the model's performance and provide a simple visualization or report for the model's performance. The prediction results should show the predicted thickness value together with its probability.

For training the model, we'll use a dataset of FTIR data from various coatings, and we'll consider all the columns except \"code\" and those that start with the prefix \"MD_\". Normalize the data and remove empty values before training. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and ease of use over performance. Implement the model in a node backend and train it on demand. The minimum acceptable accuracy should be prioritized over performance. Use the R-squared metric to evaluate the model's performance and provide a simple visualization or report for the model's performance. The prediction results should show the predicted thickness value together with its probability. Think step by step and make sure there are no errors.\n\nAdditionally, provide a code snippet showcasing how to use model from nodejs once it has been trained.\n\nExample dataset:\n\ncode\tP_706\tP_729\tP_762\tP_814\tP_876\tP_915\tP_1046\tP_1087\tP_1101\tP_1116\tP_1131\tP_1200\tP_1232\tP_1265\tP_1310\tP_1323\tP_1390\tP_1452\tP_1469\tP_1480\tP_1554\tP_1562\tP_1629\tP_1640\tP_1649\tP_1679\tP_1690\tP_1750\tP_1851\tP_1860\tP_1873\tP_1884\tMD_Project\tMD_Sample\tMD_ProjectFase\tMD_Layer\tMD_FTIRinterface\tMD_RepetitionNum\tMD_PrimerTemp\tMD_TopCoatTemp\tMD_PrimerTime\tMD_TopCoatTime\tMD_PrimerThickness\tMD_TopCoatThickness\n0\t2.905\t3.27\t1.958\t1\t1.893\t1.848\t3.225\t3.005\t3.051\t3\t2.958\t3.88\t3.649\t4.435\t3.882\t3.991\t4.051\t3.578\t3.742\t3.969\t3.867\t4.034\t2.31\t2.381\t2.\nASSISTANT: First, we need to install the necessary packages for this task.
