Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum level, which is the smallest scale of energy and matter. It is a fundamental theory in physics that helps us understand how the world works and how it works together.\n\nAt a fundamental level, quantum mechanics explains how particles like electrons and photons can exhibit behavior that seems to defy our classical understanding. These particles can be in multiple places at the same time, they can be connected to each other even when they're far apart, and they can be entangled so that the state of one particle is directly", "model": ".cache/compressed_models/3b-parameters/4bits-openllama-6", "measure": {"tokenize_time": 0.0002142938319593668, "loading_time": 2.517642406048253, "prepare_time": 0.1388855369295925, "inference_time": 1.8252821010537446, "total_time": 4.482059713918716}}, "timestamp": 13.120674767298492}, "time_elapsed": 72.97558142291382, "relative_start_at": 13.201857252046466}, {"response": {"id": 18, "prompt": "<human>: Write a python one-line lambda function that calculates dot product between two lists without using imported libraries.
