Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum level, which is the smallest scale of energy and matter. It is a fundamental theory in physics that helps us understand how the world works and how it works together.\n\nAt a fundamental level, quantum mechanics explains how particles like electrons and photons can exhibit behavior that seems to defy our classical understanding. These particles can be in multiple places at the same time, they can be connected to each other even when they're far apart, and they can be entangled so that the state of one particle is directly",

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) is a technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on smaller datasets to improve their performance on specific tasks or domains.\n\nThe idea behind LoRA is to use the large pre-trained model as a starting point and then adapt it by training smaller \"low-rank\" sub-models on a smaller labeled dataset. The low-rank sub-models are created by selecting a subset of the model's parameters and training them using a smaller, more focused dataset.\n\nThe main goal of LoRA is to reduce the computational cost of",
