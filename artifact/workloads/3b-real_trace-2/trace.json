Answer: Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to ensure we have the right answer. Now generate two more answers for the same problem that might be different but correct. Show all three answers. Now act a researcher tasked with investigating the 3 answers provided. List the flaws and faulty logic of each answer option provided. Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to ensure we have all the errors. Now, act a resolver tasked with finding which of the 3 answer options the researcher thought was the best, 2) improving the answer 3) printing the improved answer in full.
